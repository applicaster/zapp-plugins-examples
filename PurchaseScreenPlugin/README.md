# Purchase Screen Plugin

The purpose of this plugin is to demo the usage of the Applicaster In-App Purchase framework. More info about the framework can be found [here](https://github.com/applicaster/applicaster-iap-framework)

This screen plugin retrieves the purchasable items from Google Play Store / Apple Store and displays them in a list. When the user selects an item, the framework triggers a purchase flow for the selected item. 

For more information about creating screen plugins, please refer to the [Android](https://developer-zapp.applicaster.com/ui-builder/android/ScreenPlugin.html) and [iOS](https://developer-zapp.applicaster.com/ui-builder/ios/ScreenPlugin.html) documentation.
